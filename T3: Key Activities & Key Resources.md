# T3: Key Activities & Key Resources
**Team Leader:** Mark Lopez
* Light Up's goal is to provide smartphones to the consumers at an affordable price. To do this, we would have to acquire customer data first.
We would also have our website, which is our main form of distribution for Light Up. Having a website is more efficient than a local retail store because
we can cover a wider area for a low cost. All a consumer has to do is place an order through our website and provide billing and shipping details and we'll
take care of the rest.

* Key Resources

 _Product:_ our phones are physical products and must be transported to the consumer which can vary in location. The ideal method would
 be using mail carriers as they are reliable and depending on how much the consumer is willing to spend, the product can arrive faster to
 their location.
 
 _Intellectual:_ Light Up will have a trademark for our brand, a logo, and privacy policies on our website about our company.
 
 _Staff:_ Even if we operate in a digital enviroment, we still require a lot of staff. Our HQ will be here in Omaha, where it will consist of a 
 marketing team, social media team, technical support, and a programming team. Our team will operate on a general leadership of CEO, Executive Assistant Manager, Director of Marketing,
 Head of Technical Support and general staff. We also will hire staff to work at our warehouses so we have a place to store the phones and can send them in bulks.
 
 _Finance:_ Light Up will require funds to be able to start producing our product. The best approach is crowdfunding, with crowdfunding we can gather an audience
 while getting funds for our product at the same time. First we have to develop a prototype to show people what our phones are capable of.
 
 * Once we have our funding and staff we can work on our websites and servers to store consumer information and feedback. This will allow us
 to see what our demographic is and what issues we need to fix so customers are satisfied. To store this information, we will have a SQL database
 at our headquarters. Our headquarter will also have an office space with computers so we can work on designing and programming new software into our phones.
